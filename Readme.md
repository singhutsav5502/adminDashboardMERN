- **Tech Stack:**
  - MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)
  - Redux Toolkit for state management
  - Material UI React Component Library for UI design
  - nivo charts for informational charts

## Key Features

- **MVC Design Pattern:** Implemented the Model-View-Controller design pattern to establish a structured data handling system between the frontend and backend. This promotes separation of concerns and enhances code maintainability.

- **Server Side Pagination:** Setup server-side pagination to efficiently handle large datasets. The implementation allows smooth navigation and better performance for users dealing with a vast amount of data.

- **Aggregate Calls:** Utilized aggregate calls in the backend to efficiently query and process data. This ensures optimized data retrieval for the dashboard.

- **React Redux Toolkit:** Employed Redux Toolkit for state management, enabling a predictable and centralized way of handling application state.

- **Material UI & nivo charts:** Leveraged the Material UI React Component Library to build a responsive and visually appealing user interface. Integrated nivo charts to present information in an intuitive and informative manner.
